Bulk RNA-seq Automation Scripts

Description

This repository contains a set of scripts designed to automate the bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) pipeline. RNA-seq is a powerful tool used in transcriptomics to analyse the quantity and sequences of RNA in a sample at a given moment, which is crucial for understanding gene expression and regulation. Our scripts simplify the process, making it more accessible and efficient for researchers and bioinformaticians.
